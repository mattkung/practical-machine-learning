During past development, people only care how much activity they do, instead of how well they do it. This report tries to build a machine learning algorithm to predict the manner users perform the dumbbell lifting exercise. 7 different classification models are tested and the out of sample error is estimated by cross-validation error. This report suggests that bagging model and random forest model are better than other models in predicting classification of users' activities. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
