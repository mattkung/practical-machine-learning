Quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts measuring about themselves regularly to improve their health, is trending now. During past development, people only care how much activity they do, instead of how well they do it. This report tries to build a machine learning algorithm to predict the manner users perform the dumbbell lifting exercise. 7 different classification models are tested and the out of sample error is estimated by cross-validation error. This report suggests that bagging model and random forestodel are better than other models in predicting classification of users' activities.
